     * * String format, e.g. 'id = 1', i.e. `where(string $condition [, mixed ...$args])`
     * * Array format, e.g. ['id = ?' => 1, ...], i.e. `where(array $condition [, string $operator])`
     *
     * This method does NOT quote the columns you specify for the WHERE.
     * If you allow user input here, you must protected yourself against SQL injection using
     * {@link Connection::quoteIdentifier()} for the field names passed to this method.
     * If you are using special field names, e.g. reserved keywords for your DBMS, you are required to use
     * {@link Connection::quoteIdentifier()} as well.
     *
     * Note that this method does not override an already set WHERE part. Instead, multiple calls to this function add
     * the specified WHERE part using the AND operator.
     *
     * @param string|ExpressionInterface|Select|array $condition The WHERE condition
     * @param mixed $args If condition is a string, parameter values for placeholders in the condition can be passed.

     *                    these conditions. By default, this operator is {@link Sql::ALL} (AND)
